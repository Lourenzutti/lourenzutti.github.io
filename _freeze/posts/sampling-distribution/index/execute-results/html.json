But how do they\ndo these surveys? Do these polls check how all the people are going to vote?\nAccording to this <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/tables/voting/table01.xlsx\">table</a> from <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/en.html\">US Census Bureau</a> there are approximately 233.5 million\nvoting-age citizens. It would certainly require a lot of resources to ask all 233.5 million voting-age American citizens (in fact, this is what the election period is for, right? and we all know how complicated\nand expensive is organizing an election).\n\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-flow: row nowrap; align-items: center;\">\n<img src=\"imgs/biden.jpg\" width=\"13%\" />\n<img src=\"imgs/us_election_map.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n<img src=\"imgs/trump.jpeg\" width=\"13%\" />\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"source-img\">\nMap by Free Vector Maps: <a href=\"http://freevectormaps.com\">http://freevectormaps.com</a>\n</div>\n\n\nTo make things more complicated, the political scenario changes quite fast. Therefore, time is also an\nissue. Even if you had the resources to ask everyone, many political events that swing voters' opinions\ncould happen during your survey, and by the time you are finished, your results are already outdated.\n\n> <em>So, how can we learn (at least approximately) how voters are going to vote without asking every voter?</em>\n\nA natural answer for this question is: let us ask just a small portion of the voters how they are going to\nvote. This approach does provide us with a solution, but also many problems:\n\n1. How do we choose the voters to answer the survey?\n2. How many voters should answer the survey?\n3. How do we extrapolate the knowledge obtained from the Sample to the entire population of voters?\n4. Different group of voters will have different proportion of votes.\n\nIn this post, we are going to focus on points 3 and 4.\nWe will discuss points 1 and 2 in more detail later.\nLet's formalize some intuitive concepts.\n\n## Population and parameters\n\n<div class=\"box-def\">\nTarget Population\n\nThe group of all items/people that we are interested in.\n</div>\n\nIn general, we are interested in one or more unknown summary quantities that describe the entire population\n(as opposed to specific individuals in the population), and they are called parameters.\n\n<div class=\"box-def\">\nParameter\n\nA summary quantity of the population that is (usually) unknown.\n</div>\n\nParameters are unknown, we are trying to learn them because they tell us information about the population. Let's see an example.\n\n<span class=\"example\"></span> In the election problem above, the group of all American voters is\nour population.\nNote that the population is not the group of all Americans. It is the group of all American <em>voters</em>.\nWe are interested in the proportion of voters that will vote for each candidate, and the proportion of\nvoters that will abstain from voting. In this case, we have more than one parameter of interest.\n\n<div class=\"box-def box-caution\">\nCaution\n\nA common mistake many students make is to mix up a <strong>variable</strong> of interest with a <strong>parameter</strong> of interest. For example, one might be interested in the <em>average dolphin weight</em>, which is a parameter; the average weight is a quantity of the population, not of a single dolphin. However, the <em>dolphin weight</em> is what is being measured, i.e., the variable of interest.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"box-def box-exercise\">\n<p></p>\n<p>\n    Apple buys touchscreens from Samsung.

In these cases, we draw a sample from the population to learn about the population\ndistribution.\n\n<!-------------------------\n    SECTION SAMPLE\n--------------------------->\n## Sample\nWe are going to call <em>sample</em> any subset (sub-group of elements) of the population. What we hope for\nis that this subset would represent the population well, but this is not always the case. Even if the\npopulation is poorly represented by a sub-group of elements, such sub-group is still called a sample of the\npopulation.\n\n<div class=\"box-def\">\nSample\n\nA subset of the population.\n</div>\n\n\nIt is like when you are cooking. Imagine you're making a soup and want to know if the soup has enough salt.\nThen, we usually just taste a spoon of the soup (a sample). If that portion that you tasted lacks salt, you\nconclude that the whole soup lacks salt. This process is the so-called inference; you are extrapolating\nresults from a sample to the entire population. Now imagine you're cooking less waterly food, say, french\nfries. Then, you take one piece to see if you have put enough salt. But, just by chance, you ended with a\npiece that got too much salt on top of it, and you conclude wrongly that the whole basket of french fries is\nsalty. In this case, you got a sample that doesn't represent the population well. But again, it's still a\nsample.\n\n<div class='image' style=\"display: flex; flex-flow: row nowrap; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 0;\">\n<img width=\"44%\" src=\"https://melhorcomsaude.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/menina-provando-sopa.jpg\">\n<img width=\"40%\"\n    src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/02/salt_GettyImages-557995293-1024x729.jpg\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"source-img\">\nSoup Image from: <a\n    href=\"https://melhorcomsaude.com.br/receita-de-sopa-light-de-repolho/\">https://melhorcomsaude.com.br/receita-de-sopa-light-de-repolho/</a>\n\nFries image from: <a\n    href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/can-too-much-salt-lead-to-bad-skin\">https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/can-too-much-salt-lead-to-bad-skin</a>\n</div>\n\n\nThere are many different strategies to draw a sample. One of the most common strategy is called <em>random sampling without replacement</em>. To take a random sampling without replacement of size <em>n</em> elements from a population you must:\n\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        <p>List all the elements of the population.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p> Select one element at random from the population (all elements must have the same\n            probability of being selected).</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p> Save the selected element and remove it from the population.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p> Repeat Steps 2. and 3. <em>n</em> times.</p>\n    </li>\n</ol>\n\nAlthough random sampling without replacement is one of the simplest ways to draw a sample, it is still quite effective. However, in some cases, it is not the best strategy you could use. But let's not worry about this now.\n\nNow that you know the concept of <em>sample</em>, we need to revisit the concept of population. As it was mentioned, a sample is a subset of the population. But frequently the population that the sample is drawn\nfrom is not the same population we are interested in. Let us see an example.\n\n<span class=\"example\"></span>\nIn times of Covid-19, the Canadian government started providing some aid to Canadian workers that lost their\njobs. The provincial government of British Columbia (BC) is studying if it should also provide some aid to\nuniversity students. To make the decision, BC's government wants to know the average income of university\nstudents in the province. There are many universities in BC, and sampling students from all universities can\nbe costly and time-consuming.\nThe government decides to sample students only from the University of British Columbia (UBC).\nBy doing this, the sample that the government will be taking, comes from the population of all UBC students,\nwhich is a more restricted group than the group of all university students in BC.\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-flow: row nowrap; align-items: center;\">\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"imgs/sampled_population.png\"\n    style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width:450px;\">\n</div>\n\nExample 2.1 shows us that we need to improve our definition of population and make a distinction between the\n    two populations.\n\n<div class=\"box-def\">\nSampled Population\n\nThe group of all items/people which we are taking a sample from.\n</div>\n\nIdeally, the <em>Sampled Population</em> will coincide with the <em>Target Population</em>. If not, be aware\nthat the sample results can only be extrapolated (by means of statistical inference) to the Sampled\nPopulation. To extrapolate from the Sampled Population to the Target Population, you need a justification\nbeyond statistical inference -- which could be valid but could be misleading and wrong. Careful!\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that in some cases the target population and sample population differ for\nreasons other than convenience. This is very common in medical research (see the exercise below).\n\n<div class=\"box-def box-exercise\">\n<p></p>\n<p>\n    Say that a Canadian pharmaceutical company created a drug for a new disease. But now, they need to test\n    if the drug works on human beings. The company will administer the drug and a placebo on some people\n    infected by the disease who are located Canada and compare the results to see if the drug works.\n</p>\n<ol>\n    <li class=\"question-item\">\n        <p>What is the target population?</p>\n        <textarea class=\"answer\"></textarea><br>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"question-item\">\n        <p>What is the sampled population?</p>\n        <textarea class=\"answer\"></textarea><br>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"question-item\">\n        <p>What should the company do to match the sampled population to the target population?

This is clearly not reasonable. We cannot allow a company to go out there\n        infecting people with a disease to see if a treatment works! In this case, ethical issues\n        prevent us from matching the sample population with the target population.\n    </dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"box-def\">\nSample Distribution\n\nThe sample distribution is the distribution of the variable of interest over a given sample.\n</div>\n\n<span class=\"example\"></span> Let's return to the STAT 100 grades example.

Let's review the big picture.</p>\n\n<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    ----------------------------------SECTION: REVISITING THE BIG PICTURE-------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->\n\n## Revisiting the Big Picture\n\n<ol>\n<li>\nWe are interested in a specific quantity (parameter) of a given population of objects/people. For\n    example, the average income of all UBC students.\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-flow: row nowrap; align-items: center;\">\n<img width=\"75%\" src=\"imgs/population_students.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width:450px;\">\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\nDue to limited resources we cannot survey the whole population to obtain the exact value of the parameter;\n\n</li>\n<li>\nWe then take a sample at random from the population.\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-flow: row nowrap; align-items: center;\">\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"imgs/population_sample.png\"\n    style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width:600px;\">\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\nNext, we use the sample to learn about the parameter of the population. For example, if we are interested in the average income of a given population, we calculate the average income in the sample. The function/formula you are using is called <strong>estimator</strong> (e.g., sample mean, sample variance, sample quantile) and the value you obtain in a given sample is called <strong>estimate</strong> of the parameter.\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-flow: row nowrap; align-items: center;\">\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"imgs/population_estimate.png\"\n    style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width:600px;\">\n</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\nGreat, we are done! But wait for a second; the sample is random. The fact that we are using Chen, Mary, and\nAmy's average income is just due chance. It could have been Ronald, Mary, and Lien, or Jean, Wang, and\nAdebola, or any other three UBC students. Different samples would give different results.\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-flow: row nowrap; align-items: center;\">\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"imgs/population_multi_sample.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; \n                        margin-right: auto; \n                        margin-top:10px; \n                        margin-bottom:10px; \n                        max-width:600px;\">\n</div>\n\nYou might even end up with a sample that is not representative of the population. For example,\nimagine you select three unemployed students. The average income in your sample would be\nsmaller than the average income of all UBC's students, since not all UBC's students are\nunemployed.\n\n*How can we rely on an approach if every time we take a sample, we get a different estimate*?\n\n\nAdmittedly, since the estimate is a random value, the chances are that we will not hit the mark and get an\nestimate that exactly matches the value of the parameter of interest. However, we don't need to. We just\nneed a method that gives us estimates that are <em>\"close enough most of the time\"</em>.\n\n<!--------------------------------\n    SECTION SAMPLING DISTRIBUTION\n---------------------------------->\n\n## Sampling distribution\n\n<p>When trying to learn about an unknown parameter, taking a sample and getting an estimate is a very reasonable\n    approach. However, different samples will provide different estimates bringing uncertainty to the results.\n    Think about, without knowing the population, how can you know that the sample you got represents the\n    population well and will yield a good estimate for the parameter?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    To better understand the variation of the estimates caused by sampling variation, we could obtain the sample\n    mean for each one of the possible samples of a given size. For example, considering all possible samples of\n    3 UBC students, how many samples provide a sample average income between C$00.00 and C$50.00, between\n    C$50.00 and C$100.00, and so on? In other words, we could consider the sample mean of all possible samples\n    and study its distribution.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <span class=\"example\"></span> An aquarium has 20 fish.

We could, for example, calculate the probability that our statistic would be to a certain range around the parameter. But, how is this useful if we need to have access to all possible samples? In fact, if we had access to all possible samples, we would be better off just checking out the entire population. In our very small example above, we have 20 elements in the population but 1140 possible samples of size 3. Luckily for us, we do not need to have access to all possible samples to know the sampling distribution. We don't even need to know much about the population itself. This is so awesome that I will say it again: we are able to approximate the sampling distribution of a statistic even without having access to the population! All we need is a sample! The same sample that you use to calculate the statistic will also give you information on the uncertainty of your estimate.\n\n\n## Activity (Under construction)\n\nA hypothetical small city in northern Canada, named <em>Not So Cold</em>, has 2,000 residents.

If you change the estimator, you are also changing the sampling distribution. For example, imagine that you want to estimate the weight of the lightest\n        fish in the aquarium. So, instead of the sample mean, you would calculate the sample minimum. The values in the table shown in Example 4.1 would be completely different, and consequently, so would be the sampling distribution.\n    </dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n</div>\n\nNext, we will discuss two ways to approximate the sampling distribution from a single sample: (1) Bootstrapping; and (2) the Central Limit Theorem.\n\n<div style=\"height: 400px; margin-top: 100px;\">\n\n</div>\n</main>\n\n\n# Testing webr\n\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## R\n\n\n\n\n```{webr}\nprint(1:10)\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Python\n\n\n\n\n```{pyodide}\nprint(list(range(10)))\n```\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n",
